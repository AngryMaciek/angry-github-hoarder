# Angry GitHub Hoarder :hamster:

In the event of a global zombie apocalypse GitHub servers would most probably get shut down. It is not very wise to keep all the code on their servers **exclusively**. Therefore I have put together a small shell script that creates a local copy of all my work.  

Ironically, I package it as a repo... and upload to GitHub -_-
